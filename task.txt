1. SQL vs NoSQL
Relational databases use SQL, while non-relational databases use NoSQL.
SQL databases have a specified schema and employ structured query language. For unstructured data, NoSQL databases use dynamic schemas.
SQL databases scale vertically, but NoSQL databases scale horizontally.
NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores, whereas SQL databases are table-based.
SQL databases excel in multi-row transactions, while NoSQL excels at unstructured data such as documents and JSON.
