1. SQL vs NoSQL
Relational databases use SQL, while non-relational databases use NoSQL.
SQL databases have a specified schema and employ structured query language. For unstructured data, NoSQL databases use dynamic schemas.
SQL databases scale vertically, but NoSQL databases scale horizontally.
NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores, whereas SQL databases are table-based.
SQL databases excel in multi-row transactions, while NoSQL excels at unstructured data such as documents and JSON.


2. PRIMARY KEY vs CANDIDATE KEY:
Primary key: A column in a table that uniquely identifies each row. Contain unique and NOT NULL values. Only one primary key is possible in a table. Primary key is used as Foreign key in another table to establish a relationship between tables.

Candidate key: A set of column in a table that uniquely identifies each row. Like primary key, contain unique and NOT NULL values. More than one candidate key is possible in a table.
